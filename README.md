Multi language document classification system

A Multilingual Document Classification System is designed to automatically categorize documents written in multiple languages into predefined categories (e.g., news topics, legal vs. medical, sentiment classes). Here‚Äôs a structured overview of how to build or understand such a system:


---

üîß System Overview

1. Input

Documents in different languages (e.g., English, French, Spanish, Arabic).

Can be plain text, PDFs, or other formats.


2. Preprocessing

Language Detection: Use libraries like langdetect, langid, or models from fastText.

Text Normalization:

Tokenization

Stopword removal (language-specific)

Lowercasing, punctuation removal



3. Translation vs. Native Handling

Option A: Translate All to One Language (e.g., English)

Use tools like Google Translate API, DeepL.

Pros: Single model needed.

Cons: Translation errors may affect accuracy.


Option B: Native Multilingual Model

Use multilingual embeddings/models:

XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, LaBSE (sentence embeddings)

These support over 100 languages natively.


Pros: No translation needed.

Cons: Slightly more complex training and model management.

üß† Model Architecture

1. Feature Extraction

Use one of:

TF-IDF vectors (language-specific stopword handling)

Sentence embeddings (e.g., sentence-transformers)

Multilingual transformer models (e.g., XLM-R, mBERT)



2. Classifier

Traditional ML: SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest

Deep Learning: LSTM, CNN

Transformer-based: Fine-tuned BERT models for classification

‚öôÔ∏è Training Pipeline

1. Prepare Multilingual Dataset:

Collect labeled documents across different languages.

Ensure class balance.



2. Data Augmentation (optional):

Back translation

Synonym replacement



3. Training Strategy:

Use multilingual model directly

Optionally fine-tune on your dataset



4. Evaluation:

Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall

Per-language performance analysis
